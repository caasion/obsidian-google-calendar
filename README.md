## Installation

### Test client reached user limit use own client

The user limit of the test client is hit. This means that new Google accounts can't use the test client until it's verified by Google. I am working on getting the verification. For now, please resort to using your own client instead.

- One click install from [community plugin store](obsidian://show-plugin?id=google-calendar)
- Go to settings and activate plugin
- Go into plugin settings
- To _test_ the plugin set `Use own authentication client` to false
- Press Login and authenticate with google

The function to use a public OAuth client is in beta and could be removed at any time.

### Create a own OAuth client (its easy)

- [Create Google Cloud Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate?)
- [Activate Google Calendar API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/calendar-json.googleapis.com)
- [Configure OAUTH screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?)
  - Select Extern
  - Fill necessary inputs
  - Add your email as tester if using "@gmail" add gmail and googlemail
- [Add OAUTH client](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient)
  - select Webclient
  - add `http://127.0.0.1:42813` as Javascript origin
  - add `https://google-auth-obsidian-redirect.vercel.app` as Javascript origin (only required if you want to use the plugin on mobile)
  - add `http://127.0.0.1:42813/callback` as redirect URI
  - add `https://google-auth-obsidian-redirect.vercel.app/callback` as redirect URI (only required if you want to use the plugin on mobile)

#### Parameters

````
    ```gEvent
        type: [web, month, day] necessary
        date: [today, tomorrow, yesterday, A specific date] optional
        width: number optional
        height: number  optional
        navigation: boolean optional only for timeline view
        timespan: number optional only for schedule view
        include: [list of calendar ids or names]
        exclude: [list of calendar ids or names]
        theme: [light, dark, auto] only for web view
        hourRange: [start, end] only for day view
    ```
````

### Auto create Notes

The plugin allows you to generate notes automatically from Google Events.

1. To achieve this, activate it inside the settings.
1. Select an Import date range. This is the range in which events are checked. The center is always today.
1. Google events that contain `:obsidian:` inside the description will create new notes if the plugin starts

You can also define a template that should be used when creating new notes by adding the template title `:obsidian-UniTemplate:`
Make sure to activate the core plugin Templates or the Templater plugin.

You can also define a position where the new note should be saved by adding the folder location in front of the text like this `:Folder/Path-obsidian:`

Example `:Uni/Math-obsidian-UniTemplate:` Create the node in the folder Math with the Template UniTemplate.

To insert event information into templates use `{{gEvent.AnyField}}` for both plugins

Example

```
Event Description

{{gEvent.description}}

```

The fields to use are defined in the [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/v3/reference/events) and can be selected from the dropdown menu

Inserting a template strings into a file that already has an inserted event using @Annotation will automatically replace the template with the event information.

### Use daily notes

To make this plugin a one stop solution for calendars in obsidian you can enable the setting `Show daily notes`. This will allow you to see your daily notes and google events inside the month view and will add the option to view or create a daily note when opening an event select.
